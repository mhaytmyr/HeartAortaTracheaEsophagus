    Objective:
        a. Beacuse of imbalanced organs, I added weights to loss function as follows.
        Calculate all categories and divide each category to it and take log of it.
        Then weight each class with corressponding freq ratio.

    Results:
        modelName = 1x256x384_WeighteLoss_3D16_3D32_3D64_3D128_3D256_3D512_1C1024
        number of epochs: 100
        batch size: 8
	
	loss: 0.0472 {'dice_1': 0.76, 'dice_2': 0.938, 'dice_3': 0.849, 'dice_4': 0.899}
    {'dice_1': 0.756, 'dice_2': 0.945, 'dice_3': 0.879, 'dice_4': 0.919}
    val_loss: 0.0536 - val_dice_1: 0.1956 - val_dice_2: 0.1519 - val_dice_3: 0.1593 - val_dice_4: 0.3324 

    Val Results:
        ('esophagus', 0.658), ('heart', 0.91), ('trachea', 0.857), ('aorta', 0.897)
        
    Obervations: Visually contours look ok with exceptio of trachead being oversegmented 
    at the border or lung. Aorta starts starts closer to diaphramm while true labels
    start slighly upper. However, contours seem to overlap nicely. Heart is segmenting
    well in most instancesm with exception being at the bottom. Next thing, I might
    try is to Calculate weights per batch and use that in loss function, or use
    stratified data generation.

    Objective:
        a. Started training u-net to segment heart, aorta, trachea and esophagus

    Results:
        modelName = 1x256x384_Base_3D16_3D32_3D64_3D128_3D256_3D512_1C1024
        number of epochs: 100
        batch size: 8
	
	loss: 0.0208 {'dice_1': 0.756, 'dice_2': 0.945, 'dice_3': 0.879, 'dice_4': 0.919}
    val_loss: 0.0233 - val_dice_1: 0.3446 - val_dice_2: 0.2124 - val_dice_3: 0.2481 - val_dice_4: 0.4484

    Val Results:
        ('esophagus', 0.633), ('heart', 0.908), ('trachea', 0.923), ('aorta', 0.867)
        
    Obervations: For the first attempt contours look ok. trachea, heart is segmented well. The most difficult is esophagus.
    It is undersegmenting in most slices. Next attempt is to incorporate weighted loss and see if we get any improvement.
